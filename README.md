## Project Description
An Escrow Payment System is a financial arrangement where a trusted third party (the escrow) temporarily holds funds during a transaction between a buyer and a seller. 
Funds are only released when predefined conditions are met. Using Aptos blockchain and Move smart contracts,this system can be fully decentralized, trustless, and transparent.


### Key Features

- **üîê Trustless Transactions**: Smart contracts automatically handle fund management
- **‚è∞ Timeline Protection**: Automatic refunds if delivery timelines are exceeded  
- **üí∞ Secure Escrow**: Funds are locked until delivery confirmation
- **üîç Order Tracking**: Real-time status updates for all transactions
- **‚ö° Fast Settlement**: Instant fund release upon delivery confirmation
- **üåê Decentralized**: No central authority required

### How It Works

1. **Order Creation**: Buyer creates an escrow order with seller details, product info, and payment
2. **Fund Locking**: Smart contract locks buyer's funds securely 
3. **Product Delivery**: Seller delivers the product to buyer
4. **Confirmation**: Buyer confirms receipt and releases funds to seller
5. **Automatic Protection**: If timeline expires, funds are automatically refunded to buyer

### Use Cases

- **E-commerce**: Secure online marketplace transactions
- **Freelance Services**: Project-based work with milestone payments
- **Digital Assets**: Safe trading of NFTs and digital goods
- **Peer-to-Peer Trading**: Direct buyer-seller transactions
- **Service Agreements**: Professional services with delivery guarantees

## Smart Contract Details

### Contract Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Aptos Testnet
- **Language**: Move Programming Language
- **Module Address**: `0xaba3b69b006249fa70a1d34f2de400e3419705ffb0b7db0831c714a7378379d7`
- **Module Name**: `marketplace`

### Core Functions

#### Public Entry Functions

```move
// Initialize the marketplace (one-time setup)
public entry fun initialize()

// Create a new escrow order
public entry fun create_order(
    seller_addr: address,
    product_name: vector<u8>,
    amount: u64,
    timeline_hours: u64,
    marketplace_addr: address
)

// Confirm product received and release funds (buyer only)
public entry fun confirm_product_received(
    order_id: u64,
    marketplace_addr: address
)

// Process refund for expired orders (anyone can call)
public entry fun process_refund(
    order_id: u64,
    marketplace_addr: address
)
```

#### View Functions

```move
// Get all orders for a specific user
public fun get_user_orders(
    marketplace_addr: address,
    user_addr: address
): vector<Order>

// Get current escrow balance
public fun get_escrow_balance(marketplace_addr: address): u64
```

### Data Structures

#### Order Struct
```move
struct Order has key, store {
    order_id: u64,          // Unique order identifier
    buyer: address,         // Buyer's wallet address
    seller: address,        // Seller's wallet address
    product_name: vector<u8>, // Product description
    amount: u64,            // Amount in Octas (1 APT = 100,000,000 Octas)
    status: u64,            // Order status (1=pending, 2=delivered, 3=refunded)
    created_at: u64,        // Timestamp of order creation
    timeline_hours: u64,    // Delivery timeline in hours
    escrow_released: bool   // Whether funds have been released
}
```

#### Marketplace Resource
```move
struct Marketplace has key {
    orders: Table<u64, Order>,  // All orders indexed by ID
    next_order_id: u64,         // Counter for generating unique IDs
    escrow_balance: u64         // Total funds held in escrow
}
```

### Security Features

- **Access Control**: Only buyers can confirm receipt and release funds
- **Timeline Protection**: Automatic refund mechanism for expired orders
- **Fund Safety**: Funds are locked in smart contract until resolution
- **Immutable Logic**: Smart contract rules cannot be changed after deployment

### Transaction Flow

1. **Marketplace Initialization**: Deploy and initialize marketplace resource
2. **Order Creation**: Buyer sends APT tokens to escrow with order details
3. **Fund Locking**: Smart contract holds funds securely
4. **Status Tracking**: Order status updates throughout process
5. **Resolution**: Either funds released to seller or refunded to buyer
